    <h1>Russia, Ukraine</h1>
    <h2>Vladimir Putin</h2>
    <p>
      Vladimir Putin's January 15 announcement of constitutional changes and a government reshuffle launched the long-awaited period of Russiaâ€™s political transition. It is almost certain that Putin will not run for the presidency in 2024, when his current term ends. Not only will he back a chosen successor to be president, but he will reapportion the powers of the presidency and parliament while also carving out a new role for himself.
